			<h2>Zumba</h2>
			<p>I love teaching Zumba because I believe anyone can do it regardless of age, gender, size, etc. It's an "exercise in disguise" because it is so much fun! I always try
			to incorporate the basic rhythms Salsa, Merengue, Cumbria and Reggae-ton but you'll also see some Bolly-wood, tango, pop, swing and even some hip hop! My class is high
			energy, but always shows low impact moves, so anyone can join in. I try and make every class a "dance Party", so come join my "dance party"! You are guaranteed to get a
			sweat on and have a great time!</p>
			<h2>Barre</h2>
			<p>My barre class is designed to effectively strengthen, tone and balance the entire body. Fat burning workouts are used that integrate the use of the barre, light weights
			and various props (mini balls, resistance bands, gliders, etc.). Students will focus on form and precision while performing small isometric movements as instructors emphasize
			basic alignment, foundation and specific muscle actions. Each class includes several highly effective sequences of toning and resistance exercises with an emphasis on the core,
			arms, seat and thighs. Each strengh section of this workout is followed by a stretching section to create long, lean muscle without bulk. Class will end with some core work on
			the mat.</p>
			<h2>Pilates</h2>
			<p>Pilates will help you discover your inner strength, transform your mind and body, increase stamina, improve your health and achieve a new and exciting physical well being.
			Your body will totally transform form the inside out. With the use of the mat, your own body weight and props (mini balls, gliders, resistance bands & weighted balls), 
			your posture will improve, your abdominals, back and buttocks will strengthen and become more visibly toned, and your arms and legs will become leaner. Your energy level will 
			dramatically increase. Chronic back pain and other debilitating physical ailments will decrease significantly as your range of motion and mobility improves. People around you 
			will notice a substantial difference if your overall appearance.</p>
			<h2>My Fitness Philosophy</h2>
			<p>I always make sure my students are having fun, but getting a great workout in as well. If it's a Barre or Pilates class, I also want to make sure that my students' forms 
			are important and that they are being safe executing the moves.</p>
